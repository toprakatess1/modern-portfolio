# A modern portfolio site 

This project is a fully static frontend website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It does not require a backend server and can be deployed on any static hosting platform such as GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or a simple Nginx/Apache environment. The project structure is simple and designed to run directly in any modern browser. However, to properly preview the website during development, a local server is recommended because certain browser security restrictions prevent direct file execution for some features such as routing or asset loading. You may use the Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code to launch the project instantly, or start a lightweight local server using Python. For Live Server, simply open the project folder in Visual Studio Code, right-click `index.html`, and choose “Open with Live Server.” For Python users, navigate to the project directory in a terminal and run `python -m http.server` (or `python3 -m http.server` depending on your environment), then open the provided localhost URL in your browser. Once deployed, the website will run without any additional configuration since it contains only static files. This repository does not require installation steps, build tools, or package managers—simply clone the repository and open it with a local development server to begin working.
